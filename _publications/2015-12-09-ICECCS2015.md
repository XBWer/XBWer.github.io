In recent years, to help developers reduce time and effort required to build highly secure software, a number of prediction models which are built on different kinds of features have been proposed to identify vulnerable source code files. In this paper, we propose a novel approach VULPREDICTOR to predict vulnerable files; it analyzes software metrics and text mining together to build a composite prediction model. VULPREDICTOR first builds 6 underlying classifiers on a training set of vulnerable and non-vulnerable files represented by their software metrics and text features, and then constructs a meta classifier to process the outputs of the 6 underlying classifiers. We evaluate our solution on datasets from three web applications including Drupal, PHPMyAdmin and Moodle which contain a total of 3,466 files and 223 vulnerabilities. The experiment results show that VULPREDICTOR can achieve F1 and EffectivenessRatio@20% scores of up to 0.683 and 75%, respectively. On average across the 3 projects, VULPREDICTOR improves the F1 and EffectivenessRatio@20% scores of the best performing state-of-the-art approaches proposed by Walden et al. by 46.53% and 14.93%,
respectively.
